# Dovetail
Our Dovetail ensures secure communication between people.
We have secure sign up policy. Sign up is done only after the email verification from the user.
We use web tokens for authentication and authorization, which makes our app more secure . The sessions can also be retained(max 7 days for security reasons) since we use refresh tokens.
We have 'Rooms' and 'Chats' options for logged in users.
'Rooms' enable people to share their thoughts publicly. One can also create new rooms as they wish. Rooms give opportunity for one to find some other like-minded.Then,
'Chats' enables private communication between those persons.We have profile for each user, which help others to know more about them.
